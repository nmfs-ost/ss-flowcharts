# ss-flowcharts
Flowcharts for the tpl code
These files are created by drawio.Desktop

Some flowcharts are in a single file, such as readStarter.drawio.
Some are spread across multiple files that have section numbers assigned, such as readControl_4-5-2.drawio.
The section numbers align to the SS_Label numbers in the associated tpl file.
When there are multiple files, there is an index flow, such as readControl.drawio that directs to the proper sub files.
